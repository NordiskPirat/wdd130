            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            Do you usually find yourself forgetting crucial heritage
            information? Did Benedict Arnold try to betray us to the British, or
            was he just a double agent? Do you have an upcoming U.S. history
            test, and the material the professor gave you is not good enough? If
            you answered yes, no, maybe, or don't care on either of the
            questions then you have come to the right place!

            <h3>Story</h3>
            I was born and raised in Sweden for 16 years before getting the God
            blessed opportunity to move to the USA. I have as of now lived here
            for 8 years, but the lack of knowledge the people have about their
            own history is very sad. As someone who truly love the United States
            of America, even though I was not born here, my wish is that we all
            can get the information we need to not forget the past.
