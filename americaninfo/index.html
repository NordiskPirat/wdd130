            Patriots of America! Do you usually find yourself forgetting crucial
            heritage information? Did Benedict Arnold try and betray us to the
            British, or was he just a double agent? Do you have an upcoming U.S.
            history test, and the material the professor gave you is not good
            enough? If you answered yes, no, maybe, or don't care on either of
            the questions then you have come to the right place!
