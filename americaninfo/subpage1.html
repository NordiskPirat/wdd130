            <h3>The War</h3>
            The civil war was a time of unrest in the U.S.A. It broke out
            because the southern states wanted to keep slaves, so they seceded
            from the states, splitting the country into a north and south, union
            and confederacy. Slavery was a constant conflict in politics and the
            biggest reason of the war. Lincoln who opposed slavery expansion won
            the election for presidency. That finalised the ceceding. The war
            lasted for 4 years and ended with the North as the victors.

            About 10% of the casualties during the war came from military
            prisons. The union's navy was to block confederate ships and take
            control of rivers. It had 45 thousand sailors in 1865.
