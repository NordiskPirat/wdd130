            <h3>The War, a brief summary</h3>
            The civil war was a time of unrest in the U.S.A. It broke out
            because the southern states wanted to keep slaves, have more states
            rights, and other disputes. They seceded from the states, splitting
            the country into a north and south, Union and Confederacy. Slavery
            was a constant conflict in politics and a big reason of the war.
            Lincoln who opposed slavery expansion won the election for
            presidency. That finalized the ceceding. The war lasted for 4 years
            and ended with the North as the victors.
