            <h3>George Washington</h3>
            George Washington was born in 1732 in the British colony of
            Virginia. He was the oldest of 5 siblings. Their family owned a
            wealthy tobacco plantation and their power rose locally. As a
            plantation owner he was not happy about the increase in taxes by the
            British, and believed it was time for the colonies to declare
            independence. He is counted as one among the founding fathers, and
            signed the declaration of independence. Washington married Martha
            Custis in 1759, a widowed wife of Daniel Custis, a wealthy
            plantation owner. He became one of the wealthiest men in the state
            of Virginia at the time. With that, his increase in politics and
            social standings gained momentum. He died 3 years after retiring
            from presidency in 1799.

            <h3>Revolutionary War</h3>
            The British parliament was passing various Acts during the years
            before the war broke out. These Acts limited colonial business,
            increased taxes, and restricted the moving of further west. George
            Washington, being an infuluential and powerful business owner was
            outraged by the acts. He staged multiple protests and encouraged the
            boycotting of British goods. The war broke out soon after in 1775.
            During the revolutionary war he was the commander in chief of the
            continental army. Washington's tactics were based on harassing the
            British rather than face them in open combat, unless necessary. Even
            though Washington did not have a lot of experience managing a large
            number of troops, he proved to be a resilient and very capable
            leader during the revolution. Even though he lost more battles than
            he won, he employed winning strategies that won him a few battles.

            <h3>Presidency</h3>
            George Washington was elected as the first president of the United
            States on April 30, 1789. He took the oath in New York City. His
            vice president was John Adams. He was always fair when dealing with
            Native Americans, and was angered when frontiers did not treat them
            right. There were many disputes and disagreements during his first
            term, which led him to not want to run a second time. But because
            people close to him feared it would just get worse if he didn't run
            for presidency again, Washington reluctantly agreed to run a second
            time. Washington believed that alliances with foreign nations would
            only be wise if it was short lived. He declared the US neutral
            during the french and british war, because he wanted to let the
            country grow stronger before getting into any new conflicts. The
            country mourned him for a long time. He was a national hero and the
            first president of the USA.
