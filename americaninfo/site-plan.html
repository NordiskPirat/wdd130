      <h3>Civil War</h3>
      <p>
        Civil War:
The civil war was a time of unrest in the U.S.A. It broke out because the southern states wanted to keep slaves,
so they seceded from the states, splitting the country into a north and south, union and confederacy.
Slavery was a constant conflict in politics and the biggest reason of the war.
Lincoln who opposed slavery expansion won the election.
The president at the time was Abraham lincoln. He gave the Gettysburg address.
After the war was won Lincoln was killed in a theater. The war lasted for 4 years and ended with the North as the victors.
About 10% of the casualties during the war came from military prisons.
The union's navy was to block confederate ships and take control of rivers. It had 45 thousand sailors in 1865.

      <h3>George Washington</h3>
      <p>
        George Washington was born in 1732 in the British colony of Virginia. He was the oldest of 5 siblings.
        Their family owned a wealthy tobacco plantation and their power rose locally.
        During the revolutionary war he was the commander in chief of the continental army.
        Washington's tactics were based on harassing the British rather than face them in open combat, unless necessary.
        As a plantation owner he was not happy about the increase in taxes by the British, and believed it was time for
        the colonies to declare independence.
        He believed that alliances with foreign nations would only be wise if it was short lived.
        He declared the US neutral during the french and british war, because he wanted to let the country grow stronger
        before getting into any new conflicts. He died 3 years after retiring from presidency.
        The country mourned him for a long time. He was a national hero and the first president of the USA.
